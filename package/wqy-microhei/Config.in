	  WenQuanYi Micro Hei is a Hei-Ti style (sans-serif type) Chinese font.
	  It was designed for general purpose text formatting and on-screen
	  display of Chinese characters among many other languages. The embolden
	  strokes of the font glyphs produces enhanced screen contrast, making
	  it easier to read and recognize. The embedded bitmap glyphs further
	  enhance on-screen performance, and can be enabled with the provided
	  configuration files.
